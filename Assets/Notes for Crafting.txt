Variables
	Skill
	Recipe difficulty
	Stamina drain


Proccess for crafting
1) Check if the player can craft it (will be shown already)
2) Break movement
3) Determine the string length (Difficulty - skillLevel >= 2? => return Difficulty - skillLevel:2;)
4) Begin the input timer/Begin taking input
	a) There will be half a second between the taking of the same input
	b) if there is one false input, allow a reset. Fail again, move to 5
5) If the input string matches && there is time remaining, the item is crafted. Else, fail state
	5a) on fail, there is a very tiny chance (if skill > Difficulty)
